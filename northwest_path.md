# The Dead-End

Your journey northwest has brought you to a narrowing trail that abruptly ends at a towering cliff. The abrupt halt left you at the very edge, staring into a dizzying abyss below. The daunting height sends shiver down your spine as you see the forest canopy spread out beneath you, the treetops miniature from this elevated perch. This viewpoint is as awe-inspiring as it is intimidating. You realize that you have to retrace your steps in order to survive this mysterious forest.
