# The Cursed Tomb

As you journey north, the trees become taller and more ancient. The air crackles with an unknown power, and a mysterious mist veils your surroundings.

In the heart of the dense forest, you stumbled upon an ancient tomb, its moss-covered stones telling tales of a long-forgotten kingdom. Curiosity led you inside, where an ominous stillness filled the air.

As you explored, an inscription revealed the tomb's dark secret. It spoke of an ancient king who, consumed by greed and power, had brought a curse upon his lineage. Legend had it that anyone who disturbed the king's resting place would be forever bound to the shadows. Suddenly, an otherworldly wind shut the door close, and the king's spectral form materialized. The curse had been triggered, and you were now bound to the shadows, a prisoner in the cursed tomb for eternity. The forest outside continued its symphony of whispers, unaware of the ancient curse that had claimed yet another unwitting visitor.
